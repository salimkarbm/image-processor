# Image Processing Service Backend

This project aims to build a backend system for an image processing service, similar to Cloudinary. Users can upload images, apply transformations, and retrieve them in various formats. The system includes user authentication, image management, and efficient retrieval.

## Requirements

### User Authentication
- **Sign-Up**: Create a new account.
- **Log-In**: Authenticate and obtain a session.
- **JWT Authentication**: Protect endpoints with JSON Web Tokens.

### Image Management
- **Upload Image**: Store a new image.
- **Transform Image**: Apply operations such as resize, crop, rotate, watermark, etc.
- **Retrieve Image**: Fetch a saved image in the desired format.
- **List Images**: Display all user-uploaded images with metadata.

### Image Transformations
The following transformations can be implemented:

- Resize
- Crop
- Rotate
- Watermark
- Flip
- Mirror
- Compress
- Change format (JPEG, PNG, etc.)
- Apply filters (grayscale, sepia, etc.)
